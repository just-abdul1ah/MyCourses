If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?:

The average energy of the songs is 0.65906 out of 1 so it's like 66% and I think it's pretty much.
Also the loudness is around 57% and the list contains different range of songs so I would describe it as PURPLE.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?:

I think the better way to calculate aura would be using genres like in films, whether it's a sad music or happy
and make assumptions based on that.
